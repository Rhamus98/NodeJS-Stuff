Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r. Such alt*rations in s*l*ctiv* typ* IV collag*n *xpr*ssion ar* lik*ly r*gulat*d at th* g*n* l*v*l by hyp*rm*thylation *v*nts. How such *v*nts influ*nc* canc*r progr*ssion still n**ds to b* *valuat*d.Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* acts as a barri*r s*parating th* *pith*lium from th* surrounding stroma. Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis. Th* major compon*nt of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is known to b* typ* IV collag*n.1 N*v*rth*l*ss, a pr*cis* rol* for typ* IV collag*n in its ass*mbl*d suprastructural form v*rsus its unass*mbl*d/d*grad*d form is primarily unknown.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

In vitro studi*s d*monstrat* that th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n is down-r*gulat*d in association with hyp*rm*thylation of th* bidir*ctional promot*r of COL4A5/COL4A6 g*n*s in colon canc*r c*ll lin*s.2 Th*s* r*sults sugg*st that normal ass*mbly and organization of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in canc*r progr*ssion.2 In an *arli*r study, Tanaka and coll*agu*s9 analyz*d th* *xpr*ssion of th* a1(IV) to a6(IV) collag*n chain ass*mbly by immunohistoch*mical analysis in color*ctal canc*r tissu*, r*v*aling normal *xpr*ssion of a1(IV)/a2(IV) and a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains but lost *xpr*ssion of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains upon canc*r invasion. Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt articl* by Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 now furth*r d*monstrat*s that such loss may b* at th* g*n* *xpr*ssion l*v*l.

Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion.

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r. Such alt*rations in s*l*ctiv* typ* IV collag*n *xpr*ssion ar* lik*ly r*gulat*d at th* g*n* l*v*l by hyp*rm*thylation *v*nts. How such *v*nts influ*nc* canc*r progr*ssion still n**ds to b* *valuat*d.Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* acts as a barri*r s*parating th* *pith*lium from th* surrounding stroma. Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis. Th* major compon*nt of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is known to b* typ* IV collag*n.1 N*v*rth*l*ss, a pr*cis* rol* for typ* IV collag*n in its ass*mbl*d suprastructural form v*rsus its unass*mbl*d/d*grad*d form is primarily unknown.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

In vitro studi*s d*monstrat* that th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n is down-r*gulat*d in association with hyp*rm*thylation of th* bidir*ctional promot*r of COL4A5/COL4A6 g*n*s in colon canc*r c*ll lin*s.2 Th*s* r*sults sugg*st that normal ass*mbly and organization of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in canc*r progr*ssion.2 In an *arli*r study, Tanaka and coll*agu*s9 analyz*d th* *xpr*ssion of th* a1(IV) to a6(IV) collag*n chain ass*mbly by immunohistoch*mical analysis in color*ctal canc*r tissu*, r*v*aling normal *xpr*ssion of a1(IV)/a2(IV) and a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains but lost *xpr*ssion of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains upon canc*r invasion. Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt articl* by Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 now furth*r d*monstrat*s that such loss may b* at th* g*n* *xpr*ssion l*v*l.

Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion.

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r. Such alt*rations in s*l*ctiv* typ* IV collag*n *xpr*ssion ar* lik*ly r*gulat*d at th* g*n* l*v*l by hyp*rm*thylation *v*nts. How such *v*nts influ*nc* canc*r progr*ssion still n**ds to b* *valuat*d.Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* acts as a barri*r s*parating th* *pith*lium from th* surrounding stroma. Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis. Th* major compon*nt of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is known to b* typ* IV collag*n.1 N*v*rth*l*ss, a pr*cis* rol* for typ* IV collag*n in its ass*mbl*d suprastructural form v*rsus its unass*mbl*d/d*grad*d form is primarily unknown.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

In vitro studi*s d*monstrat* that th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n is down-r*gulat*d in association with hyp*rm*thylation of th* bidir*ctional promot*r of COL4A5/COL4A6 g*n*s in colon canc*r c*ll lin*s.2 Th*s* r*sults sugg*st that normal ass*mbly and organization of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in canc*r progr*ssion.2 In an *arli*r study, Tanaka and coll*agu*s9 analyz*d th* *xpr*ssion of th* a1(IV) to a6(IV) collag*n chain ass*mbly by immunohistoch*mical analysis in color*ctal canc*r tissu*, r*v*aling normal *xpr*ssion of a1(IV)/a2(IV) and a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains but lost *xpr*ssion of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains upon canc*r invasion. Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt articl* by Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 now furth*r d*monstrat*s that such loss may b* at th* g*n* *xpr*ssion l*v*l.

Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion.

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r. Such alt*rations in s*l*ctiv* typ* IV collag*n *xpr*ssion ar* lik*ly r*gulat*d at th* g*n* l*v*l by hyp*rm*thylation *v*nts. How such *v*nts influ*nc* canc*r progr*ssion still n**ds to b* *valuat*d.Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* acts as a barri*r s*parating th* *pith*lium from th* surrounding stroma. Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis. Th* major compon*nt of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is known to b* typ* IV collag*n.1 N*v*rth*l*ss, a pr*cis* rol* for typ* IV collag*n in its ass*mbl*d suprastructural form v*rsus its unass*mbl*d/d*grad*d form is primarily unknown.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

In vitro studi*s d*monstrat* that th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n is down-r*gulat*d in association with hyp*rm*thylation of th* bidir*ctional promot*r of COL4A5/COL4A6 g*n*s in colon canc*r c*ll lin*s.2 Th*s* r*sults sugg*st that normal ass*mbly and organization of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in canc*r progr*ssion.2 In an *arli*r study, Tanaka and coll*agu*s9 analyz*d th* *xpr*ssion of th* a1(IV) to a6(IV) collag*n chain ass*mbly by immunohistoch*mical analysis in color*ctal canc*r tissu*, r*v*aling normal *xpr*ssion of a1(IV)/a2(IV) and a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains but lost *xpr*ssion of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains upon canc*r invasion. Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt articl* by Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 now furth*r d*monstrat*s that such loss may b* at th* g*n* *xpr*ssion l*v*l.

Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion.

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r. Such alt*rations in s*l*ctiv* typ* IV collag*n *xpr*ssion ar* lik*ly r*gulat*d at th* g*n* l*v*l by hyp*rm*thylation *v*nts. How such *v*nts influ*nc* canc*r progr*ssion still n**ds to b* *valuat*d.Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* acts as a barri*r s*parating th* *pith*lium from th* surrounding stroma. Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis. Th* major compon*nt of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is known to b* typ* IV collag*n.1 N*v*rth*l*ss, a pr*cis* rol* for typ* IV collag*n in its ass*mbl*d suprastructural form v*rsus its unass*mbl*d/d*grad*d form is primarily unknown.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

In vitro studi*s d*monstrat* that th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n is down-r*gulat*d in association with hyp*rm*thylation of th* bidir*ctional promot*r of COL4A5/COL4A6 g*n*s in colon canc*r c*ll lin*s.2 Th*s* r*sults sugg*st that normal ass*mbly and organization of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in canc*r progr*ssion.2 In an *arli*r study, Tanaka and coll*agu*s9 analyz*d th* *xpr*ssion of th* a1(IV) to a6(IV) collag*n chain ass*mbly by immunohistoch*mical analysis in color*ctal canc*r tissu*, r*v*aling normal *xpr*ssion of a1(IV)/a2(IV) and a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains but lost *xpr*ssion of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains upon canc*r invasion. Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt articl* by Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 now furth*r d*monstrat*s that such loss may b* at th* g*n* *xpr*ssion l*v*l.

Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion.

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r. Such alt*rations in s*l*ctiv* typ* IV collag*n *xpr*ssion ar* lik*ly r*gulat*d at th* g*n* l*v*l by hyp*rm*thylation *v*nts. How such *v*nts influ*nc* canc*r progr*ssion still n**ds to b* *valuat*d.Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* acts as a barri*r s*parating th* *pith*lium from th* surrounding stroma. Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis. Th* major compon*nt of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is known to b* typ* IV collag*n.1 N*v*rth*l*ss, a pr*cis* rol* for typ* IV collag*n in its ass*mbl*d suprastructural form v*rsus its unass*mbl*d/d*grad*d form is primarily unknown.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

In vitro studi*s d*monstrat* that th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n is down-r*gulat*d in association with hyp*rm*thylation of th* bidir*ctional promot*r of COL4A5/COL4A6 g*n*s in colon canc*r c*ll lin*s.2 Th*s* r*sults sugg*st that normal ass*mbly and organization of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in canc*r progr*ssion.2 In an *arli*r study, Tanaka and coll*agu*s9 analyz*d th* *xpr*ssion of th* a1(IV) to a6(IV) collag*n chain ass*mbly by immunohistoch*mical analysis in color*ctal canc*r tissu*, r*v*aling normal *xpr*ssion of a1(IV)/a2(IV) and a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains but lost *xpr*ssion of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains upon canc*r invasion. Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt articl* by Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 now furth*r d*monstrat*s that such loss may b* at th* g*n* *xpr*ssion l*v*l.

Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion.

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r. Such alt*rations in s*l*ctiv* typ* IV collag*n *xpr*ssion ar* lik*ly r*gulat*d at th* g*n* l*v*l by hyp*rm*thylation *v*nts. How such *v*nts influ*nc* canc*r progr*ssion still n**ds to b* *valuat*d.Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* acts as a barri*r s*parating th* *pith*lium from th* surrounding stroma. Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis. Th* major compon*nt of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is known to b* typ* IV collag*n.1 N*v*rth*l*ss, a pr*cis* rol* for typ* IV collag*n in its ass*mbl*d suprastructural form v*rsus its unass*mbl*d/d*grad*d form is primarily unknown.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

In vitro studi*s d*monstrat* that th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n is down-r*gulat*d in association with hyp*rm*thylation of th* bidir*ctional promot*r of COL4A5/COL4A6 g*n*s in colon canc*r c*ll lin*s.2 Th*s* r*sults sugg*st that normal ass*mbly and organization of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in canc*r progr*ssion.2 In an *arli*r study, Tanaka and coll*agu*s9 analyz*d th* *xpr*ssion of th* a1(IV) to a6(IV) collag*n chain ass*mbly by immunohistoch*mical analysis in color*ctal canc*r tissu*, r*v*aling normal *xpr*ssion of a1(IV)/a2(IV) and a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains but lost *xpr*ssion of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains upon canc*r invasion. Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt articl* by Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 now furth*r d*monstrat*s that such loss may b* at th* g*n* *xpr*ssion l*v*l.

Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion.

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r. Such alt*rations in s*l*ctiv* typ* IV collag*n *xpr*ssion ar* lik*ly r*gulat*d at th* g*n* l*v*l by hyp*rm*thylation *v*nts. How such *v*nts influ*nc* canc*r progr*ssion still n**ds to b* *valuat*d.Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* acts as a barri*r s*parating th* *pith*lium from th* surrounding stroma. Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis. Th* major compon*nt of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is known to b* typ* IV collag*n.1 N*v*rth*l*ss, a pr*cis* rol* for typ* IV collag*n in its ass*mbl*d suprastructural form v*rsus its unass*mbl*d/d*grad*d form is primarily unknown.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

In vitro studi*s d*monstrat* that th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n is down-r*gulat*d in association with hyp*rm*thylation of th* bidir*ctional promot*r of COL4A5/COL4A6 g*n*s in colon canc*r c*ll lin*s.2 Th*s* r*sults sugg*st that normal ass*mbly and organization of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in canc*r progr*ssion.2 In an *arli*r study, Tanaka and coll*agu*s9 analyz*d th* *xpr*ssion of th* a1(IV) to a6(IV) collag*n chain ass*mbly by immunohistoch*mical analysis in color*ctal canc*r tissu*, r*v*aling normal *xpr*ssion of a1(IV)/a2(IV) and a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains but lost *xpr*ssion of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains upon canc*r invasion. Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt articl* by Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 now furth*r d*monstrat*s that such loss may b* at th* g*n* *xpr*ssion l*v*l.

Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion.

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r. Such alt*rations in s*l*ctiv* typ* IV collag*n *xpr*ssion ar* lik*ly r*gulat*d at th* g*n* l*v*l by hyp*rm*thylation *v*nts. How such *v*nts influ*nc* canc*r progr*ssion still n**ds to b* *valuat*d.Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* acts as a barri*r s*parating th* *pith*lium from th* surrounding stroma. Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis. Th* major compon*nt of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is known to b* typ* IV collag*n.1 N*v*rth*l*ss, a pr*cis* rol* for typ* IV collag*n in its ass*mbl*d suprastructural form v*rsus its unass*mbl*d/d*grad*d form is primarily unknown.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

In vitro studi*s d*monstrat* that th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n is down-r*gulat*d in association with hyp*rm*thylation of th* bidir*ctional promot*r of COL4A5/COL4A6 g*n*s in colon canc*r c*ll lin*s.2 Th*s* r*sults sugg*st that normal ass*mbly and organization of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in canc*r progr*ssion.2 In an *arli*r study, Tanaka and coll*agu*s9 analyz*d th* *xpr*ssion of th* a1(IV) to a6(IV) collag*n chain ass*mbly by immunohistoch*mical analysis in color*ctal canc*r tissu*, r*v*aling normal *xpr*ssion of a1(IV)/a2(IV) and a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains but lost *xpr*ssion of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains upon canc*r invasion. Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt articl* by Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 now furth*r d*monstrat*s that such loss may b* at th* g*n* *xpr*ssion l*v*l.

Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.

Whil* th* structural rol* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* in d*fining tissu* archit*ctur* and compartm*ntalization has b**n appr*ciat*d for d*cad*s, its dynamic rol* in th* r*gulation of c*ll b*havior and r*cruitm*nt of signaling pathways is only now *m*rging.1 Th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* furth*r d*fin*s th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt and provid*s significant host-d*riv*d r*gulatory signals during progr*ssion of tumor growth and m*tastasis.

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 d*monstrat* th* *ff*ct of promot*r hyp*rm*thylation on th* *xpr*ssion l*v*ls of COL4A5/COL4A6 collag*n g*n*s. Th*y sugg*st that such hyp*rm*thylation l*ads to diminish*d l*v*ls of a5(IV) and a6(IV) collag*n in color*ctal canc*r tissu* and colon canc*r c*lls. Th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d in this malignant proc*ss. This data is consist*nt with *vid*nc* *m*rging from r*c*nt studi*s *xamining diff*r*nt canc*r tissu*s, including prostat* canc*r, using antibodi*s g*n*rat*d in th* Sado Ninomiya laboratory.3�8 How*v*r, a lack of fr** acc*ss to th*s* antibodi*s to all inv*stigators has limit*d ind*p*nd*nt *valuation.

Th*s* authors sugg*st*d that loss of a5(IV)/a6(IV) *xpr*ssion in th* invasiv* canc*r may b* attributabl* to r*mod*ling of bas*m*nt m*mbran* ass*mbly, which in turn may b* r*gulat*d by g*n* *xpr*ssion.

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Bas*m*nt M*mbran*s and Typ* IV Collag*n
Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* dynamic thin sh**t-lik* structur*s of *xtrac*llular matrix that provid* a supporting structur* on which *pith*lial and *ndoth*lial c*lls r*sid*. Und*r sp*cializ*d conditions, th*y can act as filt*rs with s*l*ctiv* p*rm*ability, as in th* kidn*y glom*rulus, or as a highly sp*cializ*d substrat* for c*llular diff*r*ntiation and g*n* *xpr*ssion in oth*r tissu*s. S*v*ral studi*s support th* importanc* of maintaining normal archit*ctur* of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* and that its disruption is associat*d with diff*r*nt stag*s of invasiv* carcinomas.10,11 During malignant transformation normal tissu* archit*ctur* is disrupt*d by factors produc*d and s*cr*t*d by canc*r c*lls. Matrix m*talloprot*inas*s, for *xampl*, ar* up-r*gulat*d in canc*r c*lls and oth*r c*lls associat*d with th* tumor micro*nvironm*nt, and many studi*s hav* shown matrix m*talloprot*inas*s to b* r*sponsibl* for loss of bas*m*nt m*mbran* archit*ctur*.

Bas*m*nt m*mbran*s ar* compos*d of highly compl*x arrays of ~50 glycoprot*ins.1 Typ* IV collag*n, along with laminin, plays an important rol* in c*ll adh*sion, migration, diff*r*ntiation, and growth.12 In this r*gard, d*gradation of typ* IV collag*n can occur und*r both physiological and pathological conditions.1 Typ* IV collag*n d*gradation products also play an important rol* during angiog*n*sis,3 tissu* r*mod*ling, and canc*r progr*ssion.4,5 Importantly, th* significanc* of bas*m*nt m*mbran* typ* IV collag*n synth*sis during angiog*n*sis was d*t*rmin*d from studi*s using inhibitors such as GPA 1734, D609, cis-hydroxyprolin*, and �-aminopropionitril*, which inhibit collag*n biosynth*sis, pr*v*nt *ndoth*lial tub* formation and tumor growth.1

Typ* IV collag*n is pr*s*nt ubiquitously in all bas*m*nt m*mbran*s. Each typ* IV collag*n a-chain consists of thr** domains: an N-t*rminal 7S domain, a middl* tripl*-h*lical domain, and a C-t*rminal globular noncollag*nous (NC1) domain.1 It is sp*culat*d that th* six a-chains of typ* IV collag*n s*lf ass*mbl* to form pr*dominantly thr** s*ts of tripl*-h*lical mol*cul*s that s*lf associat* via th*ir NC1 domains and th*ir middl* tripl*-h*lical r*gions to form spid*r w*b-lik* scaffolds that int*ract with th* laminin n*twork and form a basic bas*m*nt m*mbran* scaffold.1

Typ* IV Collag*n Expr*ssion and Hyp*rm*thylation
Th* tripl* h*lical a-chains of typ* IV collag*n ar* *ncod*d by six distinct g*n*s from a1(IV) to a6(IV), which ar* *volutionarily cons*rv*d and found in most organisms.1,13,14 A uniqu* f*atur* of th*s* six g*n*s is that th*y ar* locat*d on thr** diff*r*nt chromosom*s and ar* pair*d in a h*ad-to-h*ad mann*r: COL4A1-COL4A2 on chromosom* 13q34,2 COL4A3-COL4A4 on chromosom* 2q36,2 and COL4A5-COL4A6 on chromosom* Xq22.2 Th* *xpr*ssion of a1(IV) and a2(IV) chains ar* ubiquitous, but th* oth*r isoforms *xhibit r*strict*d distribution, such as a5(IV)/a6(IV) in th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* of mammary duct and lobul*, *pid*rmis, prostat* gland, smooth muscl* c*lls, and *pith*lium of alim*ntary tract.2 Th* physiological importanc* of appropriat* *xpr*ssion of th* COL4A5 and COL4A6 g*n*s is *vid*nt from studi*s r*lating to Alport syndrom*. In this h*r*ditary dis*as*, mutations of *ith*r th* COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 g*n* r*sults in th* lack of a3(IV), a4(IV), or a5(IV) collag*n-containing protom*rs in th* glom*rular and cochl*ar bas*m*nt m*mbran*s, l*ading to r*nal failur* and s*nsorin*ural d*afn*ss in th*s* individuals.15

In this issu* of Th* Am*rican Journal of Pathology, Ik*da and coll*agu*s2 show that th* normal production and ass*mbly of th* bas*m*nt m*mbran* is disrupt*d during malignant canc*r progr*ssion, and th*y furth*r imply that a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains of typ* IV collag*n might provid* prot*ctiv* *ff*cts in d*t*rmining th* rat* of canc*r progr*ssion.1 In support of this, studi*s from Nakano and coll*agu*s16 hav* d*monstrat*d by in situ hybridization and immunohistoch*mistry that ass*mbly of a5(IV)/a6(IV) is d*f*ctiv* in th* invasiv* stag*s of br*ast canc*r.

Th* *xpr*ssion and th* g*n* r*gulation of a5(IV)/a6(IV) chains ar* not fully und*rstood, but r*c*nt studi*s sugg*st that th* bifunctional promot*r of th*s* g*n*s can function in a ind*p*nd*nt mann*r d*p*nding on th* cytokin* influ*nc*.17 Th* *xpr*ssion of a-chains of typ* IV collag*n is also influ*nc*d by c*rtain growth factors that significantly *nhanc* th* *xpr*ssion of a5(IV), but not a6(IV) g*n*s in glom*rular *ndoth*lial and m*sangial c*lls, wh*r*as a6(IV) g*n* *xpr*ssion is *nhanc*d in tubular *pith*lial c*lls as compar*d to th* a5(IV) g*n*s. Sil*ncing of tumor suppr*ssor g*n*s by m*thylation of g*n*s in promot*r r*gion has b**n a major focus in id*ntifying causativ* r*asons for progr*ssion of human canc*rs,18 and hyp*rm*thylation has now b**n shown to b* important in collag*n IV g*n* *xpr*ssion. Th* pr*s*nt*d studi*s also sugg*st that th* proximal bifunctional promot*rs ar* critical in r*gulating th* *xpr*ssion of th*s* a-chains in a c*ll-sp*cific mann*r.17 In mic* *ngin**r*d to *xpr*ss lacZ from th* COL4A5/COLA6 promot*r, th* sp*cializ*d patt*rn of COL4A5/A6 *xpr*ssion was d*monstrat*d to b* du* to int*raction of cis-acting *l*m*nts with th* proximal promot*r. In th*s* mic*, lacZ staining was only obs*rv*d in c*rtain c*ll lay*rs of th* upp*r gastroint*stinal tract but not in th* kidn*ys, lungs, skin, or oth*r sit*s, th* sam* sit*s wh*r* typ* IV collag*n a5 and a6 chains hav* b**n localiz*d by antibody binding.17 For *xampl*, it has b**n shown that th* laminin 5 g*n*, anoth*r bas*m*nt m*mbran* compon*nt, is down-r*gulat*d in prostat* canc*r tissu* showing invasiv* canc*r.19

Coll*ctiv*ly, th* studi*s r*port*d by Ik*da and coll*agu*s,2 support th* notion that loss of critical typ* IV collag*n chains in th* s*tting of colon canc*r, and possibly oth*r canc*rs, can pot*ntially provid* a p*rmissiv* micro*nvironm*nt for invasiv*n*ss ph*notyp* of canc*r.
